# Requirements

* You are provided `tdd_*` tools to reproduce the issue with one or more golden tests and also check for regressions.
* Don't submit until the reproduction command proves your fix.
* IMPORTANT: Always FIRST RUN the `tdd_repro` command to reproduce the issue.
* This provides you with in-depth test failure and runtime information.
* This includes `CALL_GRAPH_ON_EXCEPTION`: It contains the entire call hierarchy of all functions from that test.
